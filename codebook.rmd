# Variable Description

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

For the purposes of this project, the files in the Inertial Signals folders are not used. The files that will be used to load data are listed as follows:

    test/subject_test.txt
    test/X_test.txt
    test/y_test.txt
    train/subject_train.txt
    train/X_train.txt
    train/y_train.txt

From the dataset, we can see:

    Values of Varible Activity consist of data from “Y_train.txt” and “Y_test.txt”
    values of Varible Subject consist of data from “subject_train.txt” and subject_test.txt"
    Values of Varibles Features consist of data from “X_train.txt” and “X_test.txt”
    Names of Varibles Features come from “features.txt”
    levels of Varible Activity come from “activity_labels.txt”

So we will use Activity, Subject and Features as part of descriptive variable names for data in data frame.
